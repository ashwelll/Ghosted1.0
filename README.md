# Ghosted1.0 üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: ASH


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Ashwell Prince M - SCMS School Of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
Ghosted1.0 is a playful, interactive web app simulating a spiteful chat with an ex who consistently avoids responding. It copies the frustrating experience of being "ghosted" in a relationship through automated replies, typing indicators, and an increasing ‚ÄúGhost Level‚Äù meter that reflects how much the ex is ignoring the user. The app uses a sleek, dark-themed UI with red and black accents to evoke a dramatic atmosphere.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The world really needs is another app to help you deal with your ex ignoring you, right? We definitely don‚Äôt have enough ways to feel awkward and frustrated already. Ghosting is such a huge ‚Äúproblem‚Äù that no one‚Äôs been able to fix ‚Äî so why not just make an app that makes the whole thing even more dramatic and pointless? Perfect for anyone who enjoys unnecessary emotional torture but with style.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We can‚Äôt solve ghosting ‚Äî let‚Äôs be real, that‚Äôs impossible. So instead, Ghosted1.0 lets you embrace the pain by turning your ex‚Äôs silence into a dramatic, interactive game. With fake replies, typing dots that never end, and a ‚ÄúGhost Level‚Äù that only goes up, it‚Äôs the perfect way to waste time and make your heartbreak just a little more entertaining. Because if you‚Äôre going to get ghosted, might as well do it with some style and a bit of twisted humor.

### Project Documentation
For Software: Ghosted1.0 is a playful single-page web application simulating a mock relationship chat with an "Ex." The app is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and features a chat interface, "ghost level" progress bar, stats area, and dramatic overlays. Users can send messages, receive automated sarcastic replies, be "ghosted," and either "move on" (exit the site) or "here we go again" (reset the simulation).
Modern UI: Clean, mobile-responsive design with left-side stats and a chatting interface.
Chat Simulator: Sends messages and receives randomized "Ex" responses.
Ghost Meter: Visual progress bar of "ghost risk."
Ghosting Overlay: Dramatic end screen with "Move On" and "Here We Go Again" buttons.
Persistent Stats: Tracks sent and received messages, ghost level, and last seen.
Loop Functionality: User can reset for another run without refreshing the page.
Exit Functionality: "Move On" attempts to close the browser tab, or redirects to a blank page.

When they ghost you so hard, even the app gives up on you.
