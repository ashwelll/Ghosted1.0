# Ghosted1.0 üéØ


## Basic Details
### Team Name: ASH


### Team Members
- Team Lead: Ashwell Prince M - SCMS School Of Engineering and Technology

### Project Description
Ghosted1.0 is a playful, interactive web app simulating a spiteful chat with an ex who consistently avoids responding. It copies the frustrating experience of being "ghosted" in a relationship through automated replies, typing indicators, and an increasing ‚ÄúGhost Level‚Äù meter that reflects how much the ex is ignoring the user. The app uses a sleek, dark-themed UI with red and black accents to evoke a dramatic atmosphere.


### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
The world really needs is another app to help you deal with your ex ignoring you, right? We definitely don‚Äôt have enough ways to feel awkward and frustrated already. Ghosting is such a huge ‚Äúproblem‚Äù that no one‚Äôs been able to fix ‚Äî so why not just make an app that makes the whole thing even more dramatic and pointless? Perfect for anyone who enjoys unnecessary emotional torture but with style.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
We can‚Äôt solve ghosting ‚Äî let‚Äôs be real, that‚Äôs impossible. So instead, Ghosted1.0 lets you embrace the pain by turning your ex‚Äôs silence into a dramatic, interactive game. With fake replies, typing dots that never end, and a ‚ÄúGhost Level‚Äù that only goes up, it‚Äôs the perfect way to waste time and make your heartbreak just a little more entertaining. Because if you‚Äôre going to get ghosted, might as well do it with some style and a bit of twisted humor.
